title: YouTube越来越多的审核员
---

YouTube’s growing ranks of moderators now scan the worst videos online: torture, bombs, porn. Moderators are discouraged from working for more than two hours at a time. A psychologist is on call, and group therapy sessions are available. Some moderators are contract workers in the Philippines. Some, like those on Raul Gomez’s team, work out of San Bruno.

YouTube越来越多的审核员现在在扫描网上最糟糕的视频：酷刑，炸弹，色情。审核员每次工作不应超过两个小时。心理学家随时待命，也有群体心理疗程。一些审核员是在菲律宾雇佣的合同工。有些人，像劳尔·戈麦斯的团队，是在圣布鲁诺外工作。
